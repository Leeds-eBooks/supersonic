# Accessing data from device

The [supersonic.data](api-reference/stable/supersonic/data/) namespace includes APIs that work with any cloud data services [configured](/data-management/setting-up-appgyver-database/) for the application. They provide efficient ways for manipulating data â€“ adding, updating and deleting records.

## supersonic.data

Supersonic data provides a clean object-oriented way of manipulating data that is backed by a cloud data storage such as the AppGyver Sandbox Database.

Code snippets in allow assume that the application has defined a resource `Beer` with two `string` fields `name` and `brewery`, and an `integer` field `brewed_since` configured throught the Data configurator of the Connect Screen.

Once a resource has been defined, app can get hold of it with method [supersonic.data.model](/api-reference/stable/supersonic/data/model/model/) which takes as the parameter the resource name as string:

```js
  Beer = supersonic.data.model('Beer')
```

## Getting data from server

Method returns a [supersonic.data.Model](/api-reference/stable/supersonic/data/model/model-class/) class, that profides methods of accessing resource collections and individual resources.

The entire collection can be achieved by a [promise](/overview/promises/) returning function `findAll` of the Model class:

```js
  # all the below examples assume that variable Beer has been created as with the following
  Beer = supersonic.data.model('Beer')

  Beer.findAll().then (allBeers) ->
    # access here the collection allBeers
```

The returned object is of type [supersonic.data.Collection](/api-reference/stable/supersonic/data/model/collection-class/) that acts like an `array`:

```js
  Beer.findAll().then (allBeers) ->
    console.log "the first was #{beer[0].name}"

    for beer in allBeers
      console.log "#{beer.name} by #{beer} has been brewed since #{beer.brewed_since}"
```

Objects in the collection are of the instances of class [supersonic.data.Model] (/api-reference/stable/supersonic/data/model/model-class/).

## Limiting the search

There are several ways to how to limit what and how many objects the `findAll` returns.  Firstly one can implement, eg. pagination by using the options `skip` and `limit`:

```js
  # first page
  Beer.findAll({limit:10}).then (beers) ->

  # second page
  Beer.findAll({skip10, limit:10}).then (beers) ->
```

Option can also be a [Mongo DB](http://www.mongodb.org/) style of query parameter. The following returns all the beers where Brewery is "Schlenkerla":

```js
  query = { "brewery": "Schlenkerla" }

  Beer.findAll({query: JSON.stringify(query)}).then (beers) ->
```

Note that the value of the query has to be a stringified json.


## Three-way Data Binding

The most awesome feature of Supersonic data is it's ability to listen if the data has changed at the backend server. Listening the changes is done with method `all`:

```js
  Beer.all().whenChanged (beers) ->
    console.log "the state of the beers has chaned, current "
    for beer in allBeers
      console.log "#{beer.name} by #{beer} has been brewed since #{beer.brewed_since}"
```

Any time there are changes in data, the registered callback function is called. So with Angular's databinding and magical touch of Supersonic data one can easily build applications where the data of _all_ the users keep in sync all the time!

# Model instances

Method `find` of the Model class can be used to get a single object based on the identifier field:

```js
  Beer.find("123").then (beer) ->
    console.log "beer with id 123 is #{beer.name} by #{beer.brewery}"
```

The returned objects are instances of [supersonic.data.Model] (/api-reference/stable/supersonic/data/model/model-class/).

A model instance can be edited and the edited version saved back to the cloud database:

```js
  Beer.find("123").then (beer) ->
    beer.brewery = "Sierra Nevada Brewing"
    beer.save().then () ->
      console.log "beer saved "
```

I is also possible to delete model instances:

```js
  Beer.find("555").then (beer) ->
    beer.delete().then () ->
      console.log "a crappy beer was deleted"
```

## Creating new model instances

It is also easy to create and save new objects:

```bash
  object = {name: "Arctic Cirle Ale", brewery:"Malmgard", "brewed_since:2009"}
  beer = new Beer(object)
  beer.save().then () ->
    console.log "beer created!"
```

Once the method `save` has been called to the Model instance, the new onjects is saved to the backend server. And thanks to three way data binding, all the apps who have registered to listen changes in collection Beers will get their devices updated with the new data!
