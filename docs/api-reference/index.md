# Supersonic.js API Reference

Welcome to the Supersonic.js API Reference! This part of the Supersonic documentation provides you with just the meaty parts: how all the APIs work.

**If you are new to Supersonic**, you should start by reading through the other sections, as they also give you the context for the APIs, as well as examples and guidance on how to best utilize them.

That said, if you know what you're doing, dig into the API via the menu on the left!
