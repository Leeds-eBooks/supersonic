Steroids CLi allows you to run your applications in a simulated/emulated device on your computer. Depending on the platform there are a couple of options. iOS applications can be simulated with the simulator that comes bundled with XCode. This requires you to run Steroids on a Mac OS X. See [iOS Simulator](ios-simulator).

For Android applications, Steroids CLI ships with support for two different emulators. The "standard" Android Emulator that comes bundled with Android SDK and Genymotion. **Note** emulator support in Steroids is **work in progress** and only tested on OS X.
