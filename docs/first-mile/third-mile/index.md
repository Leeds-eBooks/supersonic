## Sharing Your App

An app isn't much good if you can't share it with someone. While you're developing your app, you can share your progress easily with a Cloud QR code, which can be scanned and run by anyone with the link and access to the AppGyver Scanner. To generate your first Cloud QR, go to the "Cloud Settings" tab in the browser and deploy your app to the AppGyver Cloud. After deploying, you will see a QR code generated on-screen. This is a cloud-based version of your app, which you can scan and preview just like a normal app, but it is not connected to your local development environment, so any new changes you make after the deploy will not update to the cloud app.

To share your progress with your friends or co-workers, click on the "open cloud share page", which will open a new browser tab with the share QR code. Now you can just copy and paste this url to anyone you want to take a look at your app.
