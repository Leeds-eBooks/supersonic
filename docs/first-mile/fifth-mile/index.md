## Overview

In this section you will learn:

- How to deploy your app to the AppGyver cloud and share it with friends or co-workers
- How to configure and request a build from the AppGyver Build Service
- How to publish your finished app

Note that building and releasing an app is an inevitably time-consuming process, so completing this mile might take a while, but the skills learned are going to be very useful to you sooner or later.
