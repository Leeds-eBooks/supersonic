# Supersonic

Naturally Supersonic is closely tied to the AppGyver tooling, but the two are still very separate entities. For this reason we have separated the tooling guides completely from the Supersonic guides. You can find the Supersonic guides here:

  - [Supersonic](/supersonic/guides/technical-concepts)

Also, quick context switching between Supersonic and tooling guides is accessible via the quick navigation dropdown in the top left corner of the page.
