# Overview
The Android wrapper comes in two flavors: vanilla and Crosswalk. Android Crosswalk is a special Android wrapper that provides it's own web runtime to run your app. This means it is not reliant on the target device's WebView implementation. This provides several performance and consistency benefits over the vanilla Android wrapper, but does result in a bigger `.apk` size. Explore the menu on the left to learn more about the AppGyver Android runtimes.
