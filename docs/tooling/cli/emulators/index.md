Steroids CLI allows you to run your application in a simulated/emulated device on your computer. Depending on the platform there are a couple of options. iOS applications can be simulated with the simulator that comes bundled with XCode. This requires you to run Steroids on Mac OS X. See [iOS Simulator](ios-simulator).

For Android applications, Steroids CLI ships with support for two different emulators. [Android Emulator](android-emulator) that comes bundled with Android SDK and [Genymotion](genymotion). We strongly advice using Genymotion.
**Note** Android emulator support is **work in progress** and only tested on OS X.
