# Cordova APIs

This section contains Cordova APIs that have not yet been given the Supersonic treatment, but are available for use in your apps. They've all been tested to work with Supersonic, so dig into the menu on the left!

We're working on bringing more Cordova APIs properly under Supersonic. What's more, we're not going to be satisfied with just wrapping the old Cordova APIs â€“ the plan is to gradually replace even the native code plugins with our own Supersonic versions. Let us know what improvements you'd like to see at [contact@appgyver.com](mailto:contact@appgyver.com)!
