# Device

Sometimes you need to access device hardware and information. While HTML5 is making leaps and strides in giving access to things like GPS data, direct access to the native interface is still better.

The `supersonic.device` namespace gives you access to the following hardware capabilities, as well as providing you useful information about the device running your app.

## Accelerometer

## Compass

## Geolocation

## Platform

The `supersonic.device.platform` is awesome
