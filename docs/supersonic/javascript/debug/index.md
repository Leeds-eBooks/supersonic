# Debugging with Supersonic.js

Squashing bugs is frustrating. Sadly, the tools available for debugging hybrid apps are not as refined as those available for the web. Plain `console.log` and `alert()` don't always cut it.

Supersonic offers several methods that help you debug your app, as well as automate tests.

See also how the [Steroids tooling helps you with debugging your app](/steroids/).

## Logger
The Supersonic Logger API is a powerful way to keep track of what's happening in your app. All logs are streamed to the [Steroids Connect](TODO) screen (as well as saved locally) for easy viewing.

* [Ping](/supersonic/api/debug/ping) â€“ ping the native side and get a "Pong" in response.
