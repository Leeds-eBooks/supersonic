# Overview - What is Supersonic?

AppGyver Supersonic goes beyond just providing a layer for integrating your HTML5 application with native device capabilities. You're able to write HTML using default CSS components that look good out of the box, use [Web Components][web-components] that map your HTML to fully native interfaces, and access native APIs with more ease than ever.

Supersonic is framework agnostic. It's a library consisting of CSS, Javascript and Web Components, which you can use with your framework of choice. However, Supersonic comes with a bundle that integrates with [Angular.js][angular-overview] by Google for even more awesomeness.
