# Architecture in a Supersonic app

In this section you will find guides on how a Supersonic app is built, where to place your content, and how to effectively build Multi-Page Applications.

## Cross-view communication

To effectively use the Supersonic Multi-Page App architecture, you need to be able to share data between various parts of your application. Since a MPA is split into multiple separate WebViews, the techniques used are slightly different â€“ but still awesome.
 Learn about different kind of solutions to share data between different views from [cross-view communication guide][communication].
