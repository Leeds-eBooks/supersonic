# Supersonic UI

This section will teach you how to utilise Supersonic components in your app. Supersonic provides access to a huge number of UI components, with special native implementations for some core components, such as the navigation and tab bars. All Supersonic components (even the native ones) can be styled with CSS, but be aware that native styling is kept separate from your basic CSS. To learn more about available components, check out the guides:

  - [CSS components][css-components]
  - [Native components][native-components]
  - [Styling native components][styling-native-components]

Besides the CSS and native components, your app's UI is influnced by:

  - [The Splashscreen][splashscreen-guide], which is shown at app start.
  - [Dialogs][dialogs-guide], which can be used to interrupt the normal flow of the app to inform the user or prompt for an action.
  - [App Rotations][rotations-guide]. You can control whether your app rotates along with the device, or lock it to a single orientation for a consistent user experience.
