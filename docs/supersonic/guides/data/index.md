# Data management

Supersonic provides an easy way to integrate any backend to your mobile app. AppGyver also provides a free Sandbox Database you can use to get development up and running quickly, if you don't have a production backend for your app yet.

The ingredients of the data access are:

 - instantly usable AppGyver Sandbox Database cloud storage
 - supersonic.data API
 - three way data binding
 - generic backend integrations

 Start your journey to Supersonic data by reading [how to configure AppGyver Sandbox Database](/supersonic/guides/data/setting-up-appgyver-database/) for your app. Then go and see how to [access data from your app](/supersonic/guides/data/accessing-data-from-device/).
